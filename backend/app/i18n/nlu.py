Language-neutral intent + entity extraction.

This is the heart of the "language should not duplicate business logic"
requirement: no matter which of the supported languages the text comes in,
`parse()` always returns the SAME shape:

    {
      "intent": "MARKET_RECOMMENDATION",
      "crop": "Soybean" | None,
      "quantity_kg": 2000.0 | None,
      "location": "Bilaspur" | None,
      "language": "mr",
      "missing": ["location"],   # entities we could NOT extract -- caller
                                  # must ask the user, never guess
    }

Everything downstream (the recommendation engine, market comparison, etc.)
only ever sees canonical English crop/market names and plain numbers --
it has no idea what language the user typed in.
