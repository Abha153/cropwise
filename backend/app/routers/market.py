    # every candidate market's outcome concurrently is what turns a worst
    # case of (markets x per-market network time) into roughly one single
    # market's worth of wall-clock time. This was previously a plain `for`

    # slow/unreachable.

    # Only `_fetch_price_outcome` (pure network, no DB) runs inside the
    # thread pool. The DB half (`_resolve_price` -- persisting a live
    # snapshot, reading the demo fallback row) always runs afterwards, back
    # on this request's own thread, against the single shared `db` Session
    # -- SQLAlchemy Sessions are not safe to use from multiple threads at
    # once, so DB access is deliberately kept single-threaded rather than
    # opening one session per worker.

    # `outcome_cache`, when supplied by the caller (admin.py's impact
    # dashboard is the only current user), is a plain dict shared across
    # MANY compare_markets calls in the same outer request -- keyed on
    # (crop, market name), since that's exactly what `_fetch_price_outcome`
    # itself is keyed on. This is deliberately separate from the TTL caches
    # already inside live_market_data.py/district_market_data.py/
    # agmarknet_service.py (those are safe to share, but only within their
    # own process-lifetime cache); this dict instead guarantees each
    # distinct (crop, market) pair is fetched over the network AT MOST
    # ONCE per admin request, even across 50 listings, without waiting on
    # any TTL. It is never used for a single normal compare_markets() call
    # (outcome_cache=None there), so the one-request, one-market-set
    # behaviour every other caller relies on is unchanged.
