"""
Weather endpoints. Thin HTTP layer over app/services/weather_service.py --
all live-fetch/fallback/validation logic lives there, not here.

Two entry points:
  GET /weather/farmer   -- auth required, uses the signed-in farmer's own
                            saved location/coordinates (Farmer.location,
                            Farmer.latitude, Farmer.longitude).
  GET /weather           -- public, ad-hoc lookup by explicit lat/lon and/or
                            a location name. This is what the "Use My
                            Location" GPS flow calls with the browser's
                            fresh coordinates, which may differ from the
                            farmer's saved profile location -- see
                            frontend/src/utils/location.js.

Weather for a set of coordinates is not private data (the same public
market/location data other CropWise endpoints like /market/nearest-market
already expose without auth), so /weather intentionally follows that same
existing precedent rather than inventing a new ownership rule for it.
