"""
Official mandi/APMC name discovery and mapping layer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
`live_market_data.fetch_live_price_status()` (kept exactly as-is -- see
that module) queries data.gov.in with `filters[market] = <name>`. That is
an EXACT string match against whatever the government dataset calls a
market. CropWise's own town/location list (`app/mock_data/locations.py`)
was built for distance/transport math, not as a government mandi
directory, so a name like "Bilaspur" is not guaranteed to be
spelled/formatted identically to the official Agmarknet "market" field
for that APMC. Matching on the raw local name alone silently produces a
lot of avoidable demo fallbacks.

This module does NOT touch or replace `fetch_live_price_status()`. It sits
in front of it:

    local town name  -->  resolve_candidate_market_names()  -->  try each
    candidate against the live resource, in confidence order, first
    genuine hit wins  -->  falls through to the district/variety resource,
    then CEDA AGMARKNET, and finally to the demo dataset, exactly as documented in
    `fetch_price_result()` below.

CONSERVATIVE MATCHING, BY DESIGN
---------------------------------
Wrong live mandi data is worse than no live data. Every candidate name
this module tries is one of:
  1. The local town name itself, tried VERBATIM as an exact server-side
     filter -- this carries no false-positive risk at all: the government
     API either has a record under that exact string or it returns
     nothing. There is no way for this step to silently return the wrong
     mandi's data.
  2. A hand-curated alias (`ALIAS_HINTS`) -- someone deliberately
     confirmed this mapping, so it's treated as maximum confidence.
  3. A fuzzy match against the real discovered market list for the state
     -- and ONLY the single best match, and ONLY if its similarity score
     clears a high bar (`FUZZY_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD`). A close-but-ambiguous
     candidate is REJECTED, not guessed at. Every fuzzy attempt (accepted
     or rejected) is logged internally (see `_log_match_decision`) with
     the local name, the candidate, the score, and the reason -- never
     surfaced to end users, but auditable server-side.

Discovery: `discover_state_markets()` asks the live API for the *actual*
list of market names the government dataset has for a state (querying
only `filters[state]`, no market/commodity filter), paginating through
ALL available pages rather than an arbitrary fixed record cap, then
fuzzy-matches CropWise's local town names against that real list (difflib
-- no extra dependency needed). Results are cached in-process for 24h so
we don't re-discover on every request.

HONESTY NOTE: exactly like `live_market_data.py`, this was written and
exercised against the failure/fallback path only -- this sandbox has no
route to api.data.gov.in. The discovery HTTP call, caching, and
confidence-scored matching logic are real, but nobody has yet watched it
resolve a real Chhattisgarh mandi name against the live dataset. Verify
with real internet access and a valid key, and expect to tune
ALIAS_HINTS below once you see the actual official names data.gov.in
returns.
