"""
Priority 8/9 — receipt generation and SHA-256 integrity.

CANONICAL FORM
--------------
The hash is computed over a canonical JSON serialisation of the receipt
payload: keys sorted, no insignificant whitespace, UTF-8, `ensure_ascii`
off so text is byte-identical regardless of how it was entered. This
matters because a hash is only useful if the SAME logical receipt always
produces the SAME bytes -- otherwise verification fails spuriously on a
dict-ordering difference and the whole mechanism is worthless.

`receipt_version` is part of the hashed payload. If the canonical form
ever changes, previously issued receipts keep verifying against the
algorithm they were generated with, rather than all silently breaking.

WHAT SHA-256 PROVES HERE
------------------------
That the stored receipt content has not been modified since generation.
NOT that the underlying transaction genuinely occurred. Any UI or
document wording must preserve that distinction -- see `INTEGRITY_NOTE`.
