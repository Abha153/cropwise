"""
Transport & logistics cost modelling.

This is the SINGLE authoritative transport calculator used everywhere in
CropWise (market comparison, buyer matching, the Advisor/Assistant, the
profit calculator, FarmPool, the admin impact dashboard) -- do not add a
second one. If a new feature needs a transport estimate, call the
functions in this module.

Every figure produced here is an ESTIMATE, never an official tariff or a
live transporter quote. It models realistic small-commercial-vehicle
economics for rural India (a per-km-times-arbitrary-rate model was
replaced because it produced implausibly low totals, e.g. ~₹950 for a
1-tonne, 106 km haul -- about ₹9/km-tonne, cheaper than diesel alone would
cost). The new model prices out: vehicle/load category, fuel (at a
configurable reference diesel price), a flat per-trip driver allocation,
per-km maintenance and vehicle overhead, tolls beyond a short free radius,
an empty return leg (the vehicle doesn't carry a return load), and a
minimum-trip floor so a short dedicated haul isn't priced as if it were
free. None of these constants are official rates -- they are labelled and
documented so they can be tuned per region/date without touching the
formula shape.
