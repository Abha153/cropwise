AgriAdvisor recommendation engine.

Combines market comparison, price forecast, arrivals (supply) trend, and a
simulated weather signal into a single, explainable selling recommendation.
Every number shown to the farmer traces back to a visible factor -- the
engine never emits a recommendation without the reasons behind it.
