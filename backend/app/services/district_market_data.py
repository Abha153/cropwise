"""
Second live government data source: "Variety-wise Daily Market Prices Data
of Commodity" (data.gov.in resource id in `settings.data_gov_in_district_resource_id`,
default 35985678-0d79-46b4-9ed6-6f13308a1d24).

This is a DIFFERENT dataset from the one `live_market_data.py` talks to --
different resource id, different (capitalized) field names, and keyed by
`District` rather than `Market`:

    filters[State], filters[District], filters[Commodity], filters[Arrival_Date]

It commonly returns multiple rows per district/commodity/day -- one per
variety/grade -- so this module aggregates them into a single district-level
price signal (average modal price across varieties for the most recent
date) while keeping the individual variety rows available too, so callers
can show real variety-level detail if useful.

This module is intentionally independent of `live_market_data.py` -- it
does not modify or replace it. `mandi_directory.fetch_price_result()` is
what tries the two in order (market-specific resource first, this
district/variety resource second, demo dataset last) and applies the
honest "Government Mandi Price" vs "District Reference Price" labeling
depending on which one actually produced the record.

HONESTY NOTE: same caveat as `live_market_data.py` -- this was written and
exercised against the failure/fallback path only, since this sandbox has
no route to api.data.gov.in. Field names above come directly from the
resource's published OpenAPI/Swagger definition, but have not been
observed against a real successful response. Verify with real internet
access and report back if the shape differs.

    Status-aware fetch of variety-wise prices for this commodity/district/
    state, most recent day. Mirrors `live_market_data.fetch_live_price_status()`'s
    three-outcome contract instead of collapsing "no matching rows" and
    "the request itself failed" into the same None:

      {"status": "ok", "result": {...}}          real rows found
      {"status": "no_records", "result": None}   API worked, nothing here
      {"status": "error", "result": None}         API call itself failed
      {"status": "not_configured", "result": None}

    Query shape follows the documented resource contract: State and
    District are the mandatory filters; Commodity is applied too since
    CropWise always has a specific crop selected at this point in the
    flow. Arrival_Date is deliberately NOT sent as a filter -- the
    dd-MM-yyyy vs dd-MM-yy formatting isn't independently confirmed here,
    and fetching without a date filter then sorting client-side by the
    returned Arrival_Date (below) sidesteps that ambiguity entirely while
    still landing on the most recent available date.

    On success, returns a dict with an aggregated `modal_price` (mean of
    that day's per-variety modal prices) plus the individual `varieties`
    list -- each variety row also carries `market` / `commodity_code` when
    the API includes those fields, captured defensively via `.get()` since
    that hasn't been independently confirmed present on every row.

    HONESTY NOTE: same caveat as `live_market_data.py` -- exercised against
    the not_configured/error paths only in this sandbox (no route to
    api.data.gov.in here). Field names come from the resource's documented
    schema, not an observed response. Verify with real internet access.
