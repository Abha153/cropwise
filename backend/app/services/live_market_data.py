"""
Live government mandi-price data integration (data.gov.in).

Resource: "Current Daily Price of Various Commodities from Various Markets
(Mandi)" -- published by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare via
the data.gov.in Open Government Data (OGD) platform, resource id
9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070 (Agmarknet-sourced).

HONESTY NOTE (important -- read before trusting this blindly):
This module implements a real HTTP client against the documented
data.gov.in API contract, using the API key configured in
`backend/.env` (see `.env.example`). It was NOT possible to verify live
connectivity to api.data.gov.in from the sandboxed development
environment this was built in -- that domain is outside the sandbox's
network allowlist. The request/response handling, field mapping, and
fallback logic have all been exercised and tested (the "API unreachable /
times out / returns no data" path is exactly what actually happens in that
sandbox, so that failure path is genuinely tested), but a live successful
fetch has not been observed by the assistant that wrote this. Please
verify against the real API once running with normal internet access, and
report back if the field names/response shape have changed -- data.gov.in
resource schemas do occasionally change without notice.

Design: CropWise NEVER lets a live-data failure break the app or silently
serve stale/wrong data as if it were fresh, and never conflates "the
government API is fine but has no record for this selection" with "the
live fetch itself failed" -- see `fetch_live_price_status()` below for
the three-way status contract that keeps those separate. `fetch_live_price()`
is kept only as a backward-compatible wrapper. Callers (see
app/services/mandi_directory.py and app/routers/market.py) fall back to
the demo dataset only on a genuine "error", and label every response with
an accurate data_source so the UI's data-transparency badge is never
guessed at.

    An explicit `cfg` may be passed by a caller that specifically needs a

    see app/routers/market.py::data_source_status(), which exists
    precisely to answer "what is configured right now" and must not report
    a stale answer just because the process was started before .env was

    Status-aware fetch, distinguishing two genuinely different situations
    that the old boolean-ish `fetch_live_price()` used to collapse into a
    single `None`:

      {"status": "ok", "result": {...}}
          A real record was found -- see `result` for the parsed row.

      {"status": "no_records", "result": None}
          The live API call itself succeeded (HTTP 200, valid JSON) but
          simply has no record for this exact crop/market/state/date
          combination. This is NOT a failure and must never trigger the
          demo-data fallback -- per spec, the honest response for this
          case is "No official government record found for this
          selection.", not a silently-substituted demo price.

      {"status": "error", "result": None}
          The live API call itself failed -- not configured, network
          error, timeout, non-200 status, or an unparseable/unexpected
          response body. THIS is the only case that should fall back to
          the demo dataset.

    Never raises. Caching mirrors the previous behaviour (both genuine
    misses and errors are cached briefly so a bad combination or an
    unreachable endpoint doesn't add multi-second delays to every request
    in a compare_markets() call).

    HONESTY NOTE: this method has been exercised end-to-end against the
    "not configured" / "error" paths only -- this build/sandbox has no
    network route to api.data.gov.in, so the "ok" and real "no_records"
    paths are implemented against the documented API contract but have
    not been observed against a real response by the assistant that wrote
    this. Verify with real internet access and a valid key.
